# GameOfLife-Riot
Coding Sample for an interview with Riot Games


## Requirements
The project is currently set up to run in Visual Studio 2022 under Windows 10.


## Use
* Run `GameOfLife.exe input`, e.g. `GameOfLife.exe test.txt`
* Input files are a list of coordinates for the next generation in the format `x,y`, one per line
* Press enter to simulate the next generation


## Explaination
This program is a basic simulation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), with a focus primarily on the efficient simulation of the board.

In order to simulate an infinite space for the cells to interact, only small chunks (SuperCells) of the board are simulated at any given time. Any SuperCell is not created or simulated until it is explicitly created. A SuperCell is created and tracked either during initial setup, or if a neighboring SuperCell contains living cells at its edges which could potentially produce living cells in a formerly empty SuperCell.


## Limitations
As the focus was on simulation and not presentation, the representation is a bit lacking compared to [more ideal simulations](https://playgameoflife.com/). Instead, each generation, all currently simulated Supercells are printed out with their relative coordinates and the simulated grid, with `.` representing dead cells and `O` representing living cells.


## Value tweaks
By default, a 16x16 SuperCell grid is used, and every generation is printed. To change:
* SuperCell grid size can be changed in `supercell.h` on line 6, altering `BITSET_SIZE`
* Generation printing frequency can be cahnged in `gameoflife.cpp` on line 11, altering `PRINTED_GEN` to the number of generations to simulate before printing the board state again
